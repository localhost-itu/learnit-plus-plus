## How to build

## Development

> [!NOTE]
> We use Bun instead of Node. If you prefer using Node we don't guarantee that building will work, but just replace `bun` with `npm` in the commands.

1. Run `bun i` if it is the first time building
2. Run `bun dev` to start the development server
3. Open [https://learnit.itu.dk/my/](https://learnit.itu.dk/my/) and start making cool stuff ðŸª„

## Production

1. Use `bun build` to build the extension and make a local build in the `build/` folder
2. Use `bun package:chrome` to generate a zip in the `build/` folder for chrome
3. Use `bun package:firefox` for a Firefox zip package
4. **Done**, time to distribute ðŸŽ‰
